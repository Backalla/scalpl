**Scalpl** provides a **lightweight wrapper** that helps you to operate on
**nested dictionaries** seamlessly **through the built-in** `dict` **API**, 
by using dot-separated string keys.

It's not a drop-in replacement for your dictionnaries, just syntactic sugar
to avoid `this['annoying']['kind']['of']['things']` and `prefer['a.different.approach']`.

No conversion cost, a thin computation overhead: that's **Scalpl**
in a nutshell.

### Installation

**Scalpl** is a Python3-only module that you can install via `pip`

```sh
pip3 install scalpl
``` 

### Usage
**Scalpl** provides two classes that can wrap around your dictionaries:

- **LightCut**: a wrapper that handles operations on nested `dict`.
- **Cut**: a wrapper that handles operations on nested `dict` and
that can cut accross `list` item.

Usually, you will only need to use the `Cut`¬†wrapper, but if you do not need to
operate through lists, you should work with the `LightCut` wrapper as its computation
overhead is a bit smaller.


These two wrappers strictly follow the standard `dict` 
[API](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#dict), that means
you can operate seamlessly on `dict`, `collections.defaultdict` or 
`collections.OrderedDict`.

Let's see what it looks like with a toy dictionary ! üëá

```Python
from scalpl import Cut

data = {
    'pokemons': [
        {
            'name': 'Bulbasaur',
            'type': ['Grass', 'Poison'],
            'category': 'Seed',
            'ability': 'Overgrow'
        },
        {   
            'name': 'Charmander',
            'type': 'Fire',
            'category': 'Lizard',
            'ability': 'Blaze',
        },
        {
            'name': 'Squirtle',
            'type': 'Water',
            'category': 'Tiny Turtle',
            'ability': 'Torrent',
        }
    ],
    'trainers': [
        {
            'name': 'Ash',
            'hometown': 'Pallet Town'
        }
    ]
}
# Just wrap your data, and you're ready to go deeper !
proxy = Cut(data)
```

You can use the built-in `dict` API to access its values.

```Python
proxy['pokemons[0].name']
# 'Bulbasaur'
proxy.get('pokemons[1].sex', 'Unknown')
# 'Unknown'
'trainers[0].hometown' in proxy
# True
```

By default, **Scalpl** uses dot as a key separator, but you are
free to use a different character that better suits your needs.

```Python
# You just have to provide one when you wrap your data.
proxy = Cut(data, sep='->')
# Yarrr!
proxy['pokemons[0]->name']
```


You can also easily create or update any key/value pair.

```Python
proxy['pokemons[1].weaknesses'] = ['Ground', 'Rock', 'Water']
proxy['pokemons[1].weaknesses']
# ['Ground', 'Rock', 'Water']
proxy.setdefault('pokemons[2].ability', 'Torrent')
# 'Torrent'
proxy.update({
    'trainers[0].region': 'Kanto',
})
```

And it is still possible to iterate over your data.
```Python
proxy.items()
# [('pokemons', [...]), ('trainers', [...])]
proxy.keys()
# ['pokemons', 'trainers']
proxy.values()
# [[...], [...]]
```

By the way, if you have to operate on a list of dictionaries,
the `Cut.all` method is what you are looking for.

```Python
pokemons = proxy['pokemons']
# Let's teach these pokemons some sick moves !
for pokemon in Cut.all(pokemons):
    pokemon['moves.Scratch.power'] = 40
```

Also, you can remove a specific or an arbitrary key/value pair.

```Python
proxy.pop('pokemons[0].category')
# 'Seed'
proxy.popitem()
# ('trainers', [...])
del proxy['pokemons[1].type']
```

Because **Scalpl** is only a wrapper around your data, it means you can get 
it back at will without any conversion cost. If you use an external API
that operates on dictionary, it will just work.

```Python
import json
json.dumps(proxy.data)
# "{'pokemons': [...]}"
```


Finally, you can retrieve a shallow copy of the inner dictionary
or remove all keys.

```Python
shallow_copy = proxy.copy()

proxy.clear()
```

Ps: If we meet some day, and you think this small stuff worths it,
you can give me a beer, a coffee or a high-five in return:
I would be really happy to share a moment with you ! üçª
